> From today, I will start to study the machine learning course taught by Professor Andrew Ng. Here I will record my study notes and experience.

# **Week 1**

## **Welcome**

*   What's machine learning?

There's a science of getting computers to learn without being \[explicitly programmed\]([https://intellipaat.com/community/7509/difference-between-machine-learning-and-explicit-programming#:~:text=Explicitly programmed%3A Writing out the,to you about Machine Learning.)（显式编程）](https://intellipaat.com/community/7509/difference-between-machine-learning-and-explicit-programming#:~:text=Explicitly%20programmed%3A%20Writing%20out%20the,to%20you%20about%20Machine%20Learning.)%EF%BC%88%E6%98%BE%E5%BC%8F%E7%BC%96%E7%A8%8B%EF%BC%89)

## Introduction

### Machine Learning

*   Grew out of work in AI
*   New capability for computers

### Examples

*   Database mining `Large datasets from growth of automation/web E.g., Web click data(网络点击数据), medical records, biology, engineering`
*   Applications can't program by hand(不能通过手工编程实现) `E.g., Autonomous helicopter, handwriting recognition(手写识别), most of Natural Language Processing(NLP)（自然语言处理）, Computer Vision(计算机视觉).`
*   Self-customizing programs `E.g., Amazon Netflix product recommendations`
*   Understanding human learning(brain, real AI)

Machine Learning definition

*   Arthur Samuel. Machine Learning: Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
*   Tom Mitchell Well -posed Learning Problem: A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

Machine learning algorithms:

*   Supervised learning(监督学习)
*   Unsupervised learning(无监督学习)
*   Others: Reinforcement learning(强化学习), recommender systems(推荐系统).
*   Also talk about: Practical advice for applying learning algorithms

### Supervised Learning

Eg1: Housing price prediction

"right answers" given

This is also called a regression problem

Regression: Predict continuous valued output(price)

Eg2: Breast cancer(malignant, begin)

*   Classification Discrete valued output(0 or 1)
